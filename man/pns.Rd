\arguments{
  \item{x}{a (d + 1) x n data matrix where each column is a unit vector in S^d and n is the sample size.
}
  \item{sphere.type}{
  a character string specifying the type of sphere fitting method.
"seq.test"
specifies sequential tests to decide either "small" or "great";
"small"
specifies Principal Nested SMALL Sphere;
"great"
specifies Principal Nested GREAT Sphere (radius pi/2);
"BIC"
specifies BIC statistic to decide either "small" or "great" at each level; 
"distr"
specifies the residual distribution for a likelihood ratio test to decide either "small" or "great" 
at each level;  
"ks.test" specifies Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to decide either "small" or "great" 
at each level;  
"var.test" specifies F test for equal variances to decide either "small" or "great" 
at each level;  
and
"bi.sphere"
specifies Principal Nested GREAT Sphere for the first part and Principal Nested SMALL Sphere for last parts. The default is "seq.test".
} 
  \item{mean.type}{
   a character string specifying the type of circular mean calculation at the last stage.
"Frechet"
specifies the Frechet mean on a circle;
"Fisher"
specifies the Fisher mle a.k.a. resultant mean.
  }
  \item{alpha}{significance level (0 < alpha < 1) used when sphere.type = "seq.test". The default is 0.1.
}
\item{R}{the number of bootstrap samples to be evaluated for the sequential test. The default is 100.}
\item{nlast.small.sphere}{the number of small spheres in the finishing part used when 
sphere.type = "bi.sphere".}
\item{output}{Logical. If TRUE then plots and some brief printed summaries are given. If FALSE then no plots or output is given.} 
\item{pointcolor}{A number or vector indicating the color of the data points plotted on the sphere S2}
\item{distr}{The distribution to be used in the likelihood ratio (LR) test, if sphere.type="distr"}
\item{penalty}{A log-prior penalty to be used in the LR test}
}
\value{A list with components
\item{resmat}{the residual matrix (X_PNS). Each entry in row k works like the kth principal component} 
\item{$PNS}{= the list with the following components.}
\item{radii}{the size (radius) of PNS.}
\item{orthaxis}{the orthogonal axis v_i of subspheres.}
\item{dist}{the distance r_i of subspheres}
\item{pvalues}{the p-values of LRT and parametric boostrap tests (if any).}
\item{ratio}{the estimated ratios. Now unavailable.}
\item{mean}{the location of the PNS mean.}
\item{sphere.type}{the type of method for fitting subspheres.}
\item{percent}{proportion of variances explained.}
\item{spherePNS}{The co-ordinates of the data points projected to the sphere in 3D (also plotted)}
\item{circlePNS}{The co-ordinates of the 2D circle projections on the sphere in 3D (also plotted)}
